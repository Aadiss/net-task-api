# net-task-api
This is my recruitment task API, which communicates  with an external API.

This simple API containts several endpoints which all are listed bellow. 

The overall point in here is to POST car make and model as a request body and after that my API shot to external API which contains some informations about such make and model
for instance, if it exists.

You can also add or delete car to our database and rate them in scale 1-5.

API is available online via heroku. The url is: https://netg-api.herokuapp.com/

Anyway there is no endpoint like that so you can go directly to https://netg-api.herokuapp.com/cars

Deployment on Heroku was done according to this guide: https://testdriven.io/blog/deploying-django-to-heroku-with-docker/
